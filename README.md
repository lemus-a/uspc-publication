Repository for data visualizations created for UNDP publication, 'SDG Policy Brief Series No. 12. Using Urban Green Spaces in the Pandemic: Example from the Republic of Korea' during internship period (Sept. '21 ~ Feb '22) with the resilience team at the UNDP Seoul Policy Centre.

As part of the editing team for the publication, I created data visualizations for survey data to create a cohesive design and improve the publication's visual impact.

Without access to the original survey data, visualizations were based on data in initial figures developed by the research team.
